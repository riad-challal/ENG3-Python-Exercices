### Exercise Statement: Checking for Vowels in a String

**Objective**: Create a program that asks the user to input a string and checks whether certain vowels (`a`, `e`, `o`) are present in the string.

**Instructions**:

1. Ask the user to input a string in lowercase.
2. Check if the vowels `a`, `e`, and `o` are present in the string.
3. For each vowel, print a message indicating whether it is present or not in the string.
4. You may assume that the userâ€™s input will be entirely in lowercase.

**Sample Output**:

- **Example 1**:

  ```
  Please type in a string: hello there
  a not found
  e found
  o found
  ```

- **Example 2**:

  ```
  Please type in a string: hiya
  a found
  e not found
  o not found
  ```

### Evaluation Criteria:
- The program must correctly check for the presence of the specified vowels.
- The program should display the result for each vowel (found or not found) in the required format.
