In a magical world, the population of a city is determined by the length of its name. 
For every letter in the city name, the city gains 1 million citizens. For example:

    The city "Paris" has 5 letters, so its population is 5,000,000.
    The city "New York" has 8 letters, so its population is 8,000,000.

Your task is to write a program in Python that:

    Asks the user to input the names of several cities (one by one). This phase stop when the user tape stop as a name of a city.
    Calculates the population for each city based on the length of its name.
    Sorts the cities by their population from largest to smallest.
    Prints the cities and their populations in order.
