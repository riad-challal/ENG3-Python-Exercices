### Exercise: Determine the Faster Runner

Write a program that asks for the names and times (in seconds) of two runners. The program should then print out the name of the faster runner. If their times are the same, the program should print a different message.

#### Sample Output 1:
```
Runner 1:
Name: Sarah
Time (in seconds): 12.5
Runner 2:
Name: Michael
Time (in seconds): 11.8
The faster runner is Michael
```

#### Sample Output 2:
```
Runner 1:
Name: Lisa
Time (in seconds): 14.2
Runner 2:
Name: John
Time (in seconds): 14.2
Lisa and John have the same time
```

#### Sample Output 3:
```
Runner 1:
Name: Emily
Time (in seconds): 9.8
Runner 2:
Name: Alex
Time (in seconds): 10.3
The faster runner is Emily
```

This exercise practices:
1. Input handling for names and numeric data.
2. Comparing values to determine the outcome.
3. Handling cases where the values are the same.
