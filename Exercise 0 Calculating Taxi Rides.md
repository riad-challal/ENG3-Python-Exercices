### Exercise: Calculating Taxi Rides

Write a program that calculates how many taxi rides are needed to transport a group of people.  
The program should:
1. Ask the user how many people need a ride.
2. Ask the user how many people can fit in one taxi.  
3. Calculate and print the number of taxis required to transport everyone. If the number doesn't divide evenly, the last taxi may carry fewer people.

#### Sample Output:
```
How many people need a ride? 10
How many people fit in one taxi? 4
Number of taxis needed: 3
```

#### Hint:
- Use the integer division operator `//` to calculate full taxis.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check if there's a remainder, indicating an extra taxi is needed.
