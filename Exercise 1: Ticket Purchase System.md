### Exercise: Ticket Purchase System

Write a program that asks the user for their name.  
- If the name is anything but **"VIP"**, the program asks how many tickets the user wants to buy and calculates the total cost. Each ticket costs **15.50**.  
- If the name is **"VIP"**, the user gets a message saying, **"Enjoy the show for free!"**, and no further input is required.  

#### Sample Output 1:
```
Please enter your name: Alice
How many tickets would you like to buy? 3
The total cost is 46.5
Enjoy your tickets!
```

#### Sample Output 2:
```
Please enter your name: VIP
Enjoy the show for free!
```

This exercise practices these concepts:
1. Conditional execution (checking for a specific input value).
2. Basic arithmetic for calculating the total cost.  
3. Input and output handling in Python.
